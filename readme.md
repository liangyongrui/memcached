## Basic usage

This example uses async-std and enables some optional features, so your Cargo.toml could look like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
async-std = { version = "1", features = ["attributes"] }
memcached = "*"
```

And then the code:

```rust
#[async_std::test]
async fn it_works() -> memcached::Result<()> {
    let client = memcached::connect("memcache://127.0.0.1:12345")?;
    client.set("abc", "hello", 100).await?;
    let t: Option<String> = client.get("abc").await?;
    assert_eq!(t, Some("hello".to_owned()));
    Ok(())
}
```

For more usage, see [doc](https://docs.rs/memcached), each method of client has example.
